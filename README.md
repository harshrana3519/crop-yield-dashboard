üåæ Crop Production Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard
üìä Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes agricultural crop production and associated costs across different Indian states. It provides insights into which crops are most productive and which incur the highest cultivation and production costs.
The dashboard helps policymakers, analysts, and agribusinesses make data-driven decisions about crop planning and resource allocation.

üß† Key Insights

Highest Cost Crops: Visualized through bar and donut charts showing the Sum of Cost of Production and Cost of Cultivation by crop type.

Production Trends: The dashboard highlights top-producing crops and their state-wise contributions.

Geographic Distribution: A filled map illustrates how crop types vary by region (e.g., Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh).

Filterable Analysis: Users can slice data by State, District, and Crop to get region-specific insights.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Data Sources:

crop_production dataset (state, district, crop, production)

Cost of production dataset (crop, cost of cultivation, cost of production)

Languages & Queries: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

üîç How to Use

Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.

Interact with the slicers to explore data by state, district, or crop type.

Hover over charts or map visuals for detailed tooltips.

Modify DAX queries or visuals to extend analysis (e.g., by adding yield or profit).

üìä Example Insights

Bihar and Madhya Pradesh show significant variation in cultivation costs across districts.

Certain crops dominate both production volume and cost metrics, highlighting opportunities for optimization.

Geographic patterns indicate regional specialization in crop types.
